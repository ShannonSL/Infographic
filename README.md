# Infographic
broke all animations and css formating for the text. All attempts to fix it failed.

Not your traditional Infographic. These quotes were chosen from 20 famous books
as inspiration for anyone who needs a pick-me-up for any reason. Be it they're just struggling to get out of bed,
they're having a hard day at work, school, home; or they just need to see something uplifting. 

The goal was to make an interactive infographic where every odd number would animate with a heart-beat animation, the title would pulse and every even quote would swing. 

each quote was to sit underneath the respective image that fit the quote.
