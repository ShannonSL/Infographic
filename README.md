# Interactive Art Infographic

This infographic will be in the form of a single scaleable bookshelf, each little graphic will be a "book" that pops out and shows the reason libraries are great and the importance of returning your library books on time. There will be small comics from the internet that pop up as well with a small caption on what the comic is refering too.
